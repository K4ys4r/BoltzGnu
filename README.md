# BoltzGnu
BoltzGnu Contains Four Gnuplot Scripts which allow to plot BoltzTraP Output Data.

	1. pTRACE_E.gp       -> To plot Trasport proporties as a function of energy at define Temperature
	2. pTRACE_E_multT.gp -> To plot Trasport proporties as a function of energy at different define Temperatures
	3. pTRACE_N.gp       -> To plot Trasport proporties as a function of Carrier Concentration at define Temperature
	4. pDOPING_T.gp      -> To plot Trasport proporties as a function of Temperature at define [n]
	
Gnuplot Version > 5.0 is required  

The Scripts are used to plot BoltzTraP Data Output (i.e *trace files and doping)<br>
In this Folder you can find two exemple files  File.trace & Doping.data<br> 

To have a quick demonstration Run:
```bash
	./Run_test
or
	sh Run_test
```
